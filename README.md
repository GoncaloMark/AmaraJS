# AmaraJS

This is my own JavaScript Framework/Library. It will be a template literal component based implementation for SPA Development.

I'm doing this for portfolio enrichment and also to understand the interns of the more advanced and optimised Frameworks/Libraries that there are available!

Feel free to review the project and contribute to it!

# How to use?

Run: npm ci

lib/ is where all the code goes!
bin/ is where the cli is!
tests/ is where all tests are!

Code in TypeScript for Type Safety!
Run tests for your Code!
